# BookBridge

BookBridge is a React-based web platform to donate and discover educational books for underprivileged children. The site features a clean UI with scrollable book cards and option to receive books from donors through e-mail and location.
The project has no backend and is of little practical use, it is a personal project for experimentation with the React.js frontend.
